## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- Grid
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned how to position two images as background and move them across the page, the same thing about the hero section of this page where there was a card and a phone photo with custom positions. Most important was to see how those elements behave across the different screen sizes and how to set the screen breakpoints to match the design.
